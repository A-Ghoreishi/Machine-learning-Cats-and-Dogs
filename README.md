# Machine-learning-Cats-and-Dogs-Classification-Project
# Introduction
This project focuses on developing a classification model that cab accurately distinguish between images of cats, and dogs. 

# Data
The dataset used consists if labeled images of these two animals, and the goal is to build a robust classification model that can effectively distinguish between them. you can see the dataset in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/cats-and-dogs-image-classification?select=train)

# Techniques and Model Evaluation
Throughout this project, various machine learning techniques are explored, starting from data preprocessing and analysis to feature extraction and model implementation. Multiple models are trained and evaluated, with a comparison of their performances to determine the most effective approach for this classification task.
